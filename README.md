# Disruption

This is a simple and funny game. In this game, there are four colors: blue, red, green, and pink.
When you press any key on your keyboard, the game starts.

One random color will blink. You have to press that same color.
After 5 seconds, another random color will blink.
Now you must press the first color and then the second color in the correct order.

This continues in the same pattern.
If you press the wrong color, the game is over and your score is shown.

This is the normal description of the Simon Game
